echo Installed OK

# libdbd-mysql-perl has been updated to libmysqlclient18, but limited to a version
# so can't use libmysqlclient18-cluster. this means to install the client package
# or on most real world systems (almost anything with perl) we can't install
# the following packages:
# 	libmysqlclient18-cluster
# 	libmysqlclient-cluster-dev
