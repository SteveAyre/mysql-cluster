# mysql-common provides the mysql-common but with a version that keeps the cluster packages happy
# We don't generate it here for 2 reasons - 1) it would conflict with a binary package produced by
# mysql-5.1 or mysql-5.5 and 2) it would affect other packages where their dependancies depend on
# a specific version of mysql-common (which also means we can't have a a mysql-cluster-common
# providing it as a virtual package as version number dependancies only consider real packages.
