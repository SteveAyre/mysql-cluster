To build packages:
	$ ./build
This will build the packages.

When built it'll upload them using dput to the 'local' repository.
This assumes the local repository is configured in dput.cf.
This means you can install using Apt, which will automatically
pull in any dependancies, including mysql-common from mysql-5.5.

To install packages:
	$ ./install
This assumes you have added the local repository to sources.list
It will do the apt-get update for you, so you can:

To build and install packages:
	$ ./build_pkg && ./install

To uninstall:
	$ ./uninstall
!!!WARNING!!! do NOT do this on a production system - it'll delete your entire datadir
